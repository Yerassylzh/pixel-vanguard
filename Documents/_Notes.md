U will need this in the future when making changes or updates:

- Analyze codebase and make sure code follows best practices and maintains scalability, readability and simplicity
- Modify Documents to follow all the changes. Always keep them concise and powerful


I want u to look at all the documents in details and deeply analyze "are they optimized to the point, when AI forgets a lot of context about the project and do those files help to quickly see how entire game system operates"? That's why analyze entire codebase and reflect all the changes (that are not recorded yet) to all the documents


It's extremely important to keep documents up to date all of the time

When u start adding some art, always save all the new ideas and enhancements for ur game in GDD documents.
E.g: XP gems must be differenciated by their size and some effects (m.b particles, colors).

Next plans:
Adding SFX and music
Randomize pitch


Even though audio manager is created now, in the future keep in mind that it must be int main menu (dont destroy on load)
