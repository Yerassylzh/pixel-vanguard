# Project Vision: Pixel Vanguard

> **"The Meat Grinder"** — A kinetic, high-octane horde survivor where thousands of enemies meet satisfying, physics-based destruction.

---

## 1. Core Concept
**Pixel Vanguard** avoids the "floaty" feel of traditional survivors. It combines **pre-rendered 3D-to-Pixel art** with **heavy combat impact** to create a visceral "meaty" experience. Characters don't just flash white when hit; they are knocked back, masses of enemies visibly push against the player, and weapons carry tangible weight.

*   **Genre:** Horde Survivor / Reverse Bullet Hell
*   **Perspective:** Top-Down 2D
*   **Platforms:** Web (Yandex/Itch.io) & Android

## 2. The "Meat Grinder" USP
Our unique selling point is **Game Feel**.
*   **Fluidity:** 3D-modeled animations baked into smooth pixel sprites (no 4-frame retro stiffness).
*   **Physics:** Enemies have mass. Explosions have force. The player carves a path through the horde physically, not just numerically.
*   **Density:** Optimized to handle 1000+ onscreen entities without lag.

## 3. Monetization (Hybrid)
**"Play for Free, Pay for Speed"**
*   **Ads (Time Currency):** Watch ads to Revive, Reroll Upgrades, or Double Gold.
*   **IAP (Money Currency):** Buy Gold Packs to unlock characters instantly, skipping the grind.

## 4. Key Pillars
1.  **Visceral Combat:** Every hit must feel satisfying.
2.  **Instant Fun:** < 5 seconds from launch to gameplay.
3.  **Infinite Scaling:** The game never "ends", it only gets harder.
